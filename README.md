# TypeGraphQL Example

An example backend API using TypeGraphQL library.

It's a GraphQL API in Node.js with TypeScript. In
this demo app I explore how TypeGraphQL addresses
the issue of reduntant code often associated with
this tech stack. It does this by allowing a developer
to define their API using classes and decorators.

## Database is SQLite

Our API serves The Open Data Dataset. It's a dataset 
containing the Open Data Portals of 100 of America's
largest cities.

We use SQLite as a local data store.
